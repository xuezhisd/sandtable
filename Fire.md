# Introduction #

The Fire.pde Processing model is a first reference application on the sandtable. It demonstrates a kind of cellular automata fire model biased to move uphill and downwind.


# Details #

The fire model loads a baked elevetion file. It needs to be integrated with the StructuredLight application where it would get the elevation directly or at least read a heightmap produced by StructuredLight.

# To Run #

  * press "w" to drop water particles that fall downhill
  * press "r" to reset the model
  * click anyhwere on the table to start a fire
  * move the windvector to affect wind strength and direction
